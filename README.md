<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Background the Project
<p align="justify">
In Indonesia, individuals and teams face significant challenges in document management, often spending up to 50% of their time searching for files and data,and duplicating work, leading to productivity losses. Our project, MindSync, aims to address this pressing issue by providing a comprehensive digital document management solution that integrates a WhatsApp bot with a mobile application. This integration allows users to manage documents seamlessly through a platform they are already familiar with, enhancing accessibility and convenience. Our research questions focus on understanding the impact of this integration on document retrieval efficiency, user adoption factors, and the challenges faced during the transition from traditional methods. By leveraging the familiarity of WhatsApp technology, MindSync seeks to enhance collaboration and streamline document workflows, ultimately empowering users to regain control over their information. Our team is motivated to tackle this problem because we recognize that efficient document management is crucial for improving productivity and facilitating seamless communication in todayâ€™s fast-paced work environment. By adopting design thinking principles, we aim to create a solution that alleviates the frustrations associated with current document management practices, positioning MindSync as a vital tool for professionals in Indonesia
